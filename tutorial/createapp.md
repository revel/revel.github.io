layout: tutorial

Use the [`revel`](/manual/tool.html#mew) command line tool to create a new application in your GOPATH and run it:
```commandline
$ cd $GOPATH
$ revel new -a myapp
Revel executing: create a skeleton Revel application
Your application has been created in:
   /home/me/gostuff/myapp

You can run it with:
   revel run -a  myapp

$ revel run -a myapp
Revel executing: run a Revel application
WARN  11:21:51 harness.go:170: No http.addr specified in the app.conf listening on localhost interface only. This will not allow external access to your application 
INFO  11:21:52    app     run.go:32: Running revel server                      
INFO  11:21:52    app   plugin.go:9: Go to /@tests to run the tests.           
Revel engine is listening on.. localhost:40935
Revel proxy is listening, point your browser to : 9000
```

*Notes* When you run an application through the command line tool `revel` it is run as a proxy.
That is why you see the revel engine is listening on port X and Revel proxy is listening on 
port Y.


$ revel run -a myapp
Revel executing: run a Revel application
WARN  20:12:59 harness.go:114: No http.addr specified in the app.conf listening on localhost interface only. This will not allow external access to your application 
Proxy server is listening on  :9000
```

```commandline

$ revel new -a github.com/myaccount/myapp
$ revel run -a github.com/myaccount/myapp
```
Open your browser to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) to see a notification that your app is ready.
